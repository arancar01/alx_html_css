# My First Portfolio

## Project Description

This project is a personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS.  It aims to showcase my skills as a front-end developer, including my proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and UI/UX design.

## Directory Structure

- `css_basic/`
  - `index.html` - The main portfolio page.
  - `tweets.html` - A page displaying my tweets (if applicable).  This might be replaced with another page showcasing your work.
  - `base.css` - Basic styles for the website.
  - `styles.css` - Additional styles for layout and design.

## Requirements

1. All files should end with a newline character.
2. A README.md file is required at the root of the project directory.
3. No external libraries are allowed.  The website must be built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  No NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.
4. Your code should be W3C compliant and validate using the W3C Validator.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Early Styling:** Basic styling was implemented using CSS.
2. **Positioning:** Flexbox was used to create the page layout.
3. **Responsive Design:**  The `class="works_on_smartphone"` attribute was added to the `<body>` tag to provide a responsive layout for mobile devices.
4. **Additional Styling:** Custom styles were added to make the website unique without changing the Flexbox layout strategy.

## Usage

You can open either `index.html` or `tweets.html` in your web browser to view the portfolio.

## Notes

- Consider adding a section detailing your technologies or skills.
- You can add a "Contact" section with your email address or social media links.
